A Document Management System (DMS) repository built in Oracle Database is designed to securely store and manage digital documents. This system provides structured storage for document metadata, file locations, user details, access permissions, and activity logs.

The DMS repository typically includes:

A DOCUMENTS table to store metadata (title, author, upload date, type, status).

A USERS table to store registered user information.

A FILE_STORAGE table or a BLOB column to reference or store file content.

A PERMISSIONS table to define user-level access (read/write/delete).

An ACCESS_LOGS table to track document access history and activity for audit purposes.

By using Oracle's advanced SQL capabilities, including BLOB data types and PL/SQL procedures, this system ensures:

Fast retrieval and secure storage of documents.

Role-based access control.

Scalability for large volumes of documents.

Integration with front-end applications or APIs.

This DMS repository serves as the backend for enterprise-level document workflows such as HR systems, project archives, legal records, and more.
